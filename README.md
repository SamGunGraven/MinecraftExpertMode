# Minecraft Expert Mode

A minecraft modpack for 1.11.2 (with an upgrade path to 1.12) that keeps the vanilla philosophy, but adds difficulty and reduce grind

Focus is on mechanics, seeking to augment instead of replace Vanilla mechanics - and add interesting new twists to make the game harder, but avoiding adding grind

Philosophy:
1. Extend existing mechanics over new blocks and machines
2. Grind does not make things harder, just more boring - automation and saving repetitive actions is good
3. The world can look beautiful even though mods wants to add all kinds of shaite to generate
